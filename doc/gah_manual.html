<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>GNU Annotated Hex (gah) is a binary file viewer with the additional
features of being able to annotate the binary fields of the file with
names and types.  It can read the annotations interactively or from a
file, and applies them to the particular file being viewed.  A well
written description file can be applied to many similar files.  For
example, one description file can be applied to all OS/2 and Windows 3.1
style DIB files.  The annotation language superficially resembles the
syntax and semantics of C.</p>

<br><hr>
<a name="Invocation"></a>
<h2>2 Program Invocation</h2>

<p>GNU Annotated Hex can be invoked on the command line without loading
an annotation file like this:
<pre>    gah hexfile</pre>
When invoked with a second argument, it loads and applies an annotation
file.  Annotation files typically end with a <tt>.gah</tt> extension:
<pre>    gah hexfile descfile.gah</pre>
It cannot load zero length files or files where it cannot determine the
file size.  If the description file contains errors, it will still load
the viewer, but none of the annotations will be applied.  It will display
the first error encountered in the description file, including the line
number that the error occurred on.</p>

<br><hr>
<a name="Viewer"></a>
<h2>3 Using the Viewer</h2>

<p>When the viewer opens it will try to determine the optimal layout.
This may vary depending on the dimensions of the terminal the program
is running on.  The program requires to be run on a terminal which
understands color.</p>

<br><hr>
<a name="KeyBindings"></a>
<h3>3.1 Key Bindings</h3>

<p>The viewer displays a movable cursor which initially highlights the
first byte of the file.  The cursor can be moved with the arrow keys.
If the cursor is moved down while on the last row of the display window,
it will cause the window to shift down one row, as long as there is more
data to view.  Likewise, moving the cursor up on the first row of the
display will scroll the window up.  Moving right on the last column of the
display will wrap the cursor around to the next line.  That is, it will
move down one row and jump back to the leftmost column.  This doesn't
occur if the cursor is also on the last row of the display.  Moving left
on the first column performs the inverse behavior.  You can scroll the
window a page at a time using the PageUp and PageDown keys.</p>

<p>You can add an annotation starting at the current position of the
cursor by pressing the <tt>a</tt> key and entering the description at the
prompt.  See the section on writing annotations for the syntax and semantics
of the annotation language.</p>

<p>You can quit the program by pressing the <tt>q</tt> key.  Any annotations
entered interactively will be lost.</p>

<br><hr>
<a name="Display"></a>
<h3>3.2 Understanding the Display</h3>

<p>The display consists of two windows, the hex window and the message window.
The hex window displays file offsets on the left, hex in the middle, and ASCII
values on the right.  The number of bytes in each row depends on the size of
the terminal the program is showing on, but will always be a power of two.
The message window is at the bottom of the screen and is by default empty.</p>

<p>If the cursor is over a field with an annotation, the whole field will be
highlighted in the hex window, and the field description will be displayed in
the message window.  The description in the message window includes the field
name on the first line, and if the field has a terminal type, its value will
be displayed on the second line.</p>

<br><hr>
<a name="Language"></a>
<h2>4 Writing Annotations</h2>

<p>File format descriptions consist of series of annotations, declarations and
statements.  Annotations are labels that include types.  These are applied to
some region of the file so that when it is displayed in the viewer, the name
and value of the field at that region can be displayed.  Declarations set some
behavior of the compiler.  Statements include control flow and environment
modifiers.  All these will be elaborated upon in the following sections.</p>

<br><hr>
<a name="Annotations"></a>
<h3>4.1 Annotations</h3>

<a name="Types"></a>
<h4>Types</h4>

<p>The simplest annotations consist of a type followed by a name.  Types can
be terminal or structures.  Terminal types are lexically one word with three
parts.  The parts are the type prefix, type width, and endianness.  There are
six type prefixs: <tt>u</tt> for unsigned types, <tt>so</tt> for signed types
in one's complement format, <tt>st</tt> for signed types in two's complement
format, <tt>sm</tt> for signed types in sign / magnitude format, <tt>s</tt>
for sized structure types, and <tt>b</tt> which is reserved for bitfields in
a future version of the program.  Following the type prefix is the type width
which is a decimal integer.  This can be any positive value for structures and
bitfields, but is restrained for integer types, usually to 4 or 8.  After that
is the endianness which is optional.  This consists of the single letter <tt>l</tt>
for least significant byte first (little endian), or <tt>m</tt> for most
significant byte first (big endian).
If the endianness is missing, it will default to least significant byte first, or
whatever has been set by <tt>lsbfirst</tt> and <tt>msbfirst</tt> declarations.
Here's a few examples of terminal types:
<pre>    u4        // unsigned 4-byte integer, little endian
    st1       // signed 1-byte integer, two's complement representation
    so2m      // signed 2-byte integer, one's complement big endian
    s100      // 100 byte structure, fields unspecified</pre>
A complete annotation, specifying an integer field called "x", might look
like this:
<pre>    u4 x;</pre>
Note that all annotations must end with a semicolon.  You can enter this in
the viewer at the prompt after hitting the <tt>a</tt> key.</p>

<p>Annotation names must begin with an alphabet character or an underscore,
followed by zero or more alphanumeric or underscore characters.  Type names
and a few other keywords can't be used as names.</p>

<p>As you might have noticed from the above example, description files can
be commented with C++ sytle comments.</p>

<p>As annotations are encountered, part of the file is matched and "eaten."
If the annotations are read from a file, matching starts from the beginning.
If annotations are read interactively, matching starts at the cursor.  The
offset where the next annotation will start matching can be set manually
with a <tt>set _ = x</tt> statement (see <a href="#Set">Set</a>).  So, for
example, if the header of file format Foo consists of a four byte "magic"
field, followed by a two byte format version
field, then you could annotate it as:
<pre>    u4 magic;
    u2 version;</pre>
Annotations are matched dynamically, so you can use control flow statements
(covered further in <a href="#ControlFlow">Control Flow</a>) to write very
general descriptions.  For example, suppose the Foo header continued for
version 1 files with a two byte creation date field, while version 2
files contained a four byte date/time creation field.  Then you could
annotate that like this (continuing the above example):
<pre>    if (version == 1)
        u2 creation_date;
    else
        u4 creation_date_time;</pre></p>

<a name="Structures"></a>
<h4>Structures</h4>

<p>Structure types can contain annotations inside of them.  A structure type
is begun with the keyword <tt>s</tt> and in future versions, <tt>b</tt>.
This is followed by a list of child annotations enclosed in matching curly
braces, like this:
<pre>    s{ u4 x; u4 y; }</pre>
Structures can contain other structures, and even most declarations and
statements.
</p>

<a name="Arrays"></a>
<h4>Arrays</h4>

<p>Repeating annotations (arrays) consist of a type, a name, and a repeat count enclosed
in square brackets like C-style array declarations:
<pre>    u4 x[4];
    s{ st2 m[16]; u4 n[5]; } p[2];</pre>
Only single dimensional arrays are allowed.  An array can have zero elements,
which means it doesn't exist.</p>

<a name="Parameters"></a>
<h4>Parameters</h4>

<p>Annotations can also have parameters.  These are basically just additional
identification on top of the name.  This is useful for annotations that are
added in <tt>while</tt> loops:
<pre>    set n = 0;
    while (n < foo)
        u1 x(n);</pre>
You can annotations in a while loop without parameters, but you'll have trouble
telling them apart when they're displayed, and you'll only be able to reference
the last one added in expressions (note: in gah 0.5 alpha, annotations with
parameters are not supported in expressions anyway, but this will be added in
gah 0.5).  You can added parameters to arrays as well.  The parameter applies
to the entire array, so the repeat count comes first:
<pre>    st2 x[4](n);</pre></p>

<br><hr>
<a name="Declarations"></a>
<h3>4.2 Declarations</h3>

<a name="Endianness"></a>
<h4>Endianness</h4>

<p>There are two declarations affecting default endianness:
<tt>lsbfirst</tt> and <tt>msbfirst</tt>.  The first sets the default
endianness to little endian and the latter sets it to big endian.  This
means that a type written without specifying the endianness (in the third
part - see the section <a href="#Types">Types</a>) will default to the
given endianness.  Note that these declarations are executed dynamically
when the annotations are applied, not when the file is parsed.  This means
they can be used conditionally.  For example, some binary files can store
data in either format and use a flag near the beginning of the file to
indicate which format is used.  Hypothetically, say a file indicated big
endian if the first byte is <tt>1</tt> and little endian if it's <tt>0</tt>.
Then this would work for both cases:
<pre>    u1 big_endian_flag;
    if (big_endian_flag)
        msbfirst;</pre>
The effect of these statements last until another such statement is executed
or the execution of the description completes.  That is, the effect is not
scoped, but it also doesn't last after the description file, or interactively
input description string has finished being applied.</p>

<br><hr>
<a name="Statements"></a>
<h3>4.3 Statements</h3>

<a name="ControlFlow"></a>
<h4>Control Flow</h4>

<p>There are two control flow statements: <tt>if</tt> / <tt>else</tt> and
<tt>while</tt>.  These have the same syntax and semantics as in C.  If the
condition of the <tt>if</tt> or <tt>while</tt> evaluates to nonzero, then
the annotation, declaration or statement immediately following (called the
body) is processed.  In the case of <tt>while</tt>,
the statement is processed repeatedly until the condition evaluates to zero.
Therefore, something in the body must change the value of the condition, or
an infinite loop will occur.  If an <tt>else</tt> follows an <tt>if</tt>
statement, and the condition of the <tt>if</tt> evaluates to zero, then the
statement following the <tt>else</tt> is executed.  An <tt>else</tt> is
always paired up with the last finished <tt>if</tt> statement preceding it.
The body of an <tt>if</tt>, <tt>else</tt>, or <tt>while</tt> may contain more
than one annotation, declaration or statement provided they are enclosed in
curly braces.  Here are some examples:
<pre>    if (foo < 5) u4 x; else s{ u2 p1; u2 p2; } x[10];

    if (! foo) set t = 7;
    else { u3 m; u1 n; }

    set n = 0; while (n < 24)
    {
        if (n % 2)
            if (n & 10)
                u2 z(n);
            else
                u4 z(-n);
        set n = n + 1;
    }

    if (foo) { if (bar) u2 w; }
    else so1 q;</pre></p>

<a name="Set"></a>
<h4>Set</h4>

<p><tt>set</tt> statements allow you to assign values to variables.  The
syntax is
<pre>set id = expr;</pre>
where <tt>id</tt> is the name of the variable (allowed names are the same
as those allowed for annotation names - see <a href="#Types">Types</a>)
and <tt>expr</tt> is evaluated to obtain the value of the variable (see
<a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>).  The expression is evaluated
eagerly, when the <tt>set</tt> statement is executed.  If <tt>id</tt> was
previously defined in another <tt>set</tt> statement, or anywhere as the name of
a top-level terminal annotation, the value of the last executed <tt>set</tt>
statement will take
precedence when the identifier is used in expressions.  If the name was
used for an annotation in a structure, then that name will have the value
in the set expression when used by itself, but the structure member can
still be accessed when used as a member of the parent structure.
Similarly, if the name is used for a structure at the top-level, then
it can still be used to refer to the structure members.  Likewise, arrays
at the top-level can be accessed by subscript.  In other words, <tt>set</tt>
names are only recognized when they appear unadorned, without member
access, array subscript, or parameter, etc., but then they take precedence
over annotations.  For example:
<pre>    set x = 2;
    u1 x;        // say this has the value 4
    u1 y(x);     // this will be y(2) since set takes precedence over annotation names

    s {
        u1 x;    // say this has value 6
    } y;
    u1 z(y.x);   // this will be z(6)
    set y = 8;
    u1 q(y.x);   // q(6)
    u1 r(y);     // r(8)

    u1 a[7];
    set a = 10;
    u1 t(a[3]);  // using a[3] from u1 a[7], etc.</pre>
<tt>set</tt> names are set dynamically, are not scoped, and do not remain
once the current file or interactively input description has finished
executing.</p>

<p>A special case of <tt>set</tt> statement is when we set the identifier
<tt>_</tt>.  The special identifier <tt>_</tt> holds the offset where the
current annotation will be applied if the expression is used in a repeat
count or parameter of an annotation, or inside a structure.  It holds the offset where the
next annotation will be applied if it is used outside of an annotation (at
the top-level).  You can set this offset at the top-level to another offset
so long as the destination offset is not already contained by an annotation.
For example, suppose a file started like this:
<pre>    u4 x;        // Applied at offset 0
    set _ = 12;
    u4 y;        // Applied at offset 12</pre></p>

<br><hr>
<a name="Expressions"></a>
<h3>4.4 Expressions</h3>

<a name="Atomic"></a>
<h4>Numbers and Symbols</h4>

<p>Expressions in GAH intentionally mimic the syntax and semantics of
expressions in C, except in a few places.  Atomic expressions include
simple numbers and symbols.  Numbers can be written in decimal or
hexadecimal notation.  Hexadecimal numbers are prefixed with <tt>0x</tt>
or <tt>0X</tt> and can be either upper- or lower-case.  Examples of
valid numbers are <tt>4114</tt>, <tt>0xabcd1234</tt>, <tt>0xF00bA2</tt>, etc.
Identifiers are explained in the section <a href="#Types">Types</a>.  A
simple identifier will reference either a top-level annotation or a
<tt>set</tt> variable (see <a href="#Set">Set</a>).  Members inside
structures can be accessed with the <tt>.</tt> (dot) operator as in C.
Array annotation members can be accessed with a subscript expression
enclosed in matching square brackets.  Here are some examples:
<pre>    u4 x;                    // (1)
    s{ u4 x1; u4 x2; } z1;   // (2)
    s{ s{ u4 m2; } m1; } m;  // (3)
    u4 a[8];                 // (4)
    s{ u4 x; } z2[4];        // (5)
    s{ u4 x[10]; } z3[2];    // (6)

    set foo = x;             // (1)
    set foo = z1.x2;         // (2)
    set foo = m.m1.m2;       // (3)
    set foo = a[7];          // (4)
    set foo = z2[1].x;       // (5)
    set foo = z3[0].x[9];    // (6)</pre>
In each case, the number in parenthesis shows the relation between the
declaration and use of each particular symbol.</p>

<a name="Operators"></a>
<h4>Operators</h4>

<p>GAH has many of the operators available in C.  Notable exceptions
include assignment statements (including increment and decrement) and the
comma operator.  There is also no unary plus operator since this is
unnecessary.  Following is a table of operators in order of precedence:
<table>
  <tr><th>Operators</th><th>Associativity</th></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>[] .</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>! ~ -</tt></td><td>right to left</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>* / %</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>+ -</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>&lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>== !=</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>&amp;</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>^</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>|</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>&amp;&amp;</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>||</tt></td><td>left to right</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>?:</tt></td><td>right to left</td></tr>
</table>
There are also signed and unsigned types in GAH.  Unlike C, all values
are the same size.  Constants default to signed type.  The special varible
<tt>_</tt> is always unsigned, as is the special field <tt>#</tt>.  When
signed and unsigned types are mixed in expressions, signed types are
converted to unsigned types in the same way they are in C.  This means
that if a negative value is converted to an unsigned type, the value is
the largest representable value in the unsigned type that is congruent
to the original value modulo two to the width of the unsigned type.  While
this is admittedly rather nasty, it's done for the same reason it's done
in C: because that way we can represent signed and unsigned types with a
unified internal representation.  Further, it may be added as a feature in
a later version that GAH can output C code that will read binary files
based on their description files, and if this feature is added it may be
important that conversions occur in the same way as in C.  On the other
hand, if this behavior ends up causing problems, I may take it out and
implement arithmetic <em>the right way</em>.
There are two instances where GAH takes a stand and doesn't
mimic the behavior of C: comparisons and conditional expressions.  When
a comparison between signed and unsigned types, the result is always
correct (<em>i.e.</em>, a negative value always compares less than an
unsigned value).  In conditional expressions, the two possible results
need not have the same type, and the resulting type is the same as the
type of the chosen expression.  Other than the exceptions stated here,
the operators act identically to their equivalents in C, except with
some error checking (<em>e.g.</em>, on array bounds and division).</p>

<a name="Self"></a>
<h4>$</h4>

<p>The special object <tt>$</tt> (pronounced <em>self</em>) is used to stand
for the current annotation.  When used in a repeat count, or parameter,
it stands for the annotation for which that expression will be applied.
When used in a structure and not in one of the above cases, it stands for
the enclosing structure.  It must be followed by a member access.  Here
are some examples:
<pre>    s{ u4 x; set foo = $.x; } t1;    // $.x stands for t1.x
    s{ u4 y; } t2($.y);              // $.y stands for t2.y</pre>
You can use <tt>$$</tt> (pronounced <em>super</em>) to stand for the
parent structure of <tt>$</tt>
and <tt>$$$</tt> (<em>super-duper</em>?) to stand for the grandparent structure and so on.
We'll call <tt>$</tt>, <tt>$$</tt>, etc. relative references.
Here are some more examples:
<pre>    s{ u4 x; u4 y[$$.x]; } t1;    // $ stands for y so $$ stands for t1
    u4 u; s{ u4 v; set foo = $$.u + $.v; } t2;</pre>
It should be noted that subscripts are not allowed on relative references.
This makes sense because by definition <tt>$</tt> may not be completely
instantiated and therefore we can't necessarily know its size needed to
perform subscript calculations.  Further, any annotation referenced by a
relative reference cannot repeat (be an array) because if it did it would
be dubious as to which element exactly the relative reference referred to
(and without being able to subscript the relative reference, it can't be
made explicit).  Here are some examples to hopefully make the problems clear:
<pre>    s{ u4 x; } t1[$.x];          // illegal: is $ t1[0], t1[1], etc.?

    s{ u4 x; u4 y[$$.x]; } t2;    // this is ok
    // but the following is illegal: t3[0].x and t3[1].x may differ and hence
    // t3[0] and t3[1] may differ in size which violates array semantics
    s{ u4 x; u4 y[$$.x]; } t3[2];

    // the following is why subscripts are illegal on $: to find the value of
    // t4[1].x, we must know the size of t4[0], but this could be either 4 or
    // 104 depending on the value of t4[1].x
    s{ u4 x; if ($[1].x) u4 y[100]; } t4[2];

    // this is ok since t6.x is referenced and t6 doesn't repeat; it doesn't
    // matter if t5 repeats since it's not itself referenced by anything
    s{ u4 x; s{ u4 y; if ($$.x) u4 z; } t5[2]; } t6;

    // this is illegal since t7 is referenced and, although it doesn't directly
    // repeat, it indirectly repeats because its parent repeats
    s{ s{ u4 x; u4 y[$$.x]; } t7; } t8[2];</pre></p>

<a name="Nth"></a>
<h4>#</h4>

<p>This special field will probably be removed in a future version and should not
be used.  The idea was that it would be the number of times an annotation had
been applied, therefore giving a simple way to assign unique parameters to
annotations in <tt>while</tt> loops.  For example:
<pre>    while (foo) {
        u4 x($.#);
        set foo = foo - 1;
    }</pre>
The first time the body of the loop executed, <tt>x(1)</tt> would be applied,
the second time <tt>x(2)</tt> would be applied, etc.  However, this feature is
only syntactic sugar as the same goal can be accomplished like this:
<pre>    set n = 1;
    while (foo) {
        u4 x(n);
        set n = n + 1;
        set foo = foo - 1;
    }</pre>
While this isn't quite as pretty, it'll do.  Besides, I plan to add string types
in a future version, and when that is implemented, the paramaters for annotations
will likely usually be strings instead of numbers, further reducing the need for
<tt>#</tt>.</p>

<br><hr>
<a name="Debugging"></a>
<h3>4.5 Debugging</h3>

<p>Sometimes the annotation files aren't as easy to write as you might first
think, and you get error messages or wrong results when you try to load them.
To help debug the description files, you can run the program with the
<tt>--debug-file=</tt><em>&lt;filename&gt;</em> option.  This will dump
state info to <em>&lt;filename&gt;</em> as the annotations are applied.  This
info includes names and values of variables, and annotations that are added,
along with repeat counts, paramters and offsets.  It should be fairly self
explanatory looking at the output.  There is no <tt>print</tt> or <tt>debug</tt>
statement you can put in your description files because you can get pretty
close to the same effect with <tt>set</tt> statements.  If you want to see the
value of some expression at some point in the file, try setting a variable to
that value.  The name of the variable doesn't matter, as long as it's not used
in the program.  For example:
<pre>    // I want to know the value the while condition
    while (foo[n].x + bar[m] - 1 < 7)
        ...

    // so I can rewrite it as
    set dummy = foo[n].x + bar[m] - 1;
    while (dummy < 7)
        ...</pre>
Since the value of all set expressions are dumped to the debug log, you can
then peek at the values of expressions.</p>

<p>One problem that can occur is that of infinite loops.  If it appears the
description file has an infinite loop in it (you load a file and the program
hangs), try typing Ctrl-C to stop execution and return to the viewer (this
was implemented in 0.5 Beta, so it's not available in 0.5 Alpha).</p>
